## Game Description:

Have you ever felt a looming trepidation at the thought of your next Chinese School dictation? Consider this game your liberation!  

You are a student in KW chinese school and you don't want to let down your chinese school teacher or your parents! In order to match your parents’ and teachers’ standards, you must pass all of your dictations for the course. 

The chinese characters being tested on in the course are the top 1000 most commonly used chinese characters according to Wikipedia. Finishing the course is no small feat, it will take an extremely dedicated student to learn the entirety of the course content! 

You will be given a number of words per dictation that is dependent upon the difficulty level you choose. You can choose how long you choose to “study” and memorize the characters. In order to stay in the course, you cannot get more than a certain number of words wrong for your dictation.

Once you are done practicing, the dictation commences, and you will be tested on your knowledge. If you forget a word, you can press the “I forgot” button. Through this method, you can build strong foundations in the chinese language before moving on.

After you choose to end your session, your performance will be displayed, allowing you to track your progress and where there might be room for improvement. As an added bonus, an enlightening statement accompanies every new dictation. All memes were sourced from reputable sites online.

Combining both education and excitement, you will be able to learn how to write your characters, as well as enjoy the time you spend learning them. Friendly for both seasoned dictation-writers and also beginners to the chinese language, this game is made for all. 

There will be three levels of difficulty that users can select from:

 * Easy - You will need to memorize three chinese characters for every dictation. You will only be 	  kicked out of the game if you’ve gotten ten characters wrong.
 * Medium - You will need to memorize six chinese characters for every dictation. You will only be 
   kicked out of the game if you’ve gotten five characters wrong.
 * Hard - You will need to memorize ten chinese characters for every dictation. You will only be
